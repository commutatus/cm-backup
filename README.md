cm-backup v1.x
===========

This project is forked from [backup/backup](https://github.com/backup/backup). Due to lack of help availiable we've hosted our own version on [ruby-gems](https://rubygems.org/gems/cm-backup) and will also maintain it on this repository. [The existing documentation](https://backup.github.io/backup/v4/) is already in a fantastic shape, we'll keep adding to it as needed.

__Description from source__

Backup is a system utility for Linux and Mac OS X, distributed as a RubyGem, that allows you to easily perform backup
operations. It provides an elegant DSL in Ruby for _modeling_ your backups. Backup has built-in support for various
databases, storage protocols/services, syncers, compressors, encryptors and notifiers which you can mix and match. It
was built with modularity, extensibility and simplicity in mind.
